    <div style="text-align: justify;">Over the weekend I attended my first Pycon in Dublin, Ireland. It is organised by the wonderful crowd of&nbsp;Python Ireland (<a href="http://python.ie/" target="_blank" title="Python Ireland">http://python.ie/</a>), I would actually recommend that you go to one of their monthly meetups if you have any interest in the Python language.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tof2006/15326249998" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Day 2 off to a start #pycon by Christophe Gue, on Flickr"><img alt="Day 2 off to a start #pycon" class="aligncenter" height="500" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3953/15326249998_055d89afd3.jpg" width="500" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Main stage at Pycon 2014</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I was not sure what to expect, but the experience turned out to be truly enjoyable, and I finished up the weekend, my head full of ideas to investigate with python.<br /><br />Here's my favourite highlights of the weekend, in no particular order.<br /><ul><li>Ian Ozsvald (<a href="https://twitter.com/ianozsvald">@ianozsvald</a>):&nbsp;<strong>The Real Unsolved Problems in Data Science</strong><br />You can read it there:<br /><a href="http://ianozsvald.com/2014/10/11/my-keynote-at-pyconireland-2014-the-real-unsolved-problems-in-data-science/">http://ianozsvald.com/2014/10/11/my-keynote-at-pyconireland-2014-the-real-unsolved-problems-in-data-science/</a></li><br /><li>A lightning talk by @<a href="https://twitter.com/saoili">saoili</a> about getting into python jobs, which comfort me in my current chosen path.<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">For those who were sensibly asleep when I tweeted this at 2am, my <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/pyconie?src=hash">#pyconie</a> lightning talk slides: <a href="http://t.co/xTvf1Y2k4e">http://t.co/xTvf1Y2k4e</a><br /><br />— Saoilí (@saoili) <a href="https://twitter.com/saoili/status/521248011033542656">October 12, 2014</a></blockquote></li><br /><li>On the same lightning talk show, a very entertaining demonstration of failing at data science (Homeless cloud by an engineer from rehabstudios, I forgot the name), but also a silent presentation by&nbsp;<a class="ProfileHeaderCard-screennameLink u-linkComplex js-nav" href="https://twitter.com/dontusethiscode">@<span class="u-linkComplex-target">dontusethiscode</span></a>.</li><br /><li>Rachel Willmer (@rwillmer) in her keynote: "A Tech Person's Adventures in Startup", gave me some inspiration and food for thoughts on creating your own company.</li><br /><li>I realize that Python was widely used in the financial industry (something I did not know before ) thanks to&nbsp;Dr. Yves J. Hilpisch (<a href="https://twitter.com/dyjh">@dyjh</a>) keynote : "Python and the Financial Industry".</li><br /><li>Finally a very cool demonstration, inside iPython notebook on how to build an earth centered universe by&nbsp;Brandon Rhodes (<a href="https://twitter.com/brandon_rhodes">@brandon_rhodes</a>).</li></ul><br />Overall fun, exciting and energizing conference, I will probably be back next year, more engaged.
