The number of Books on data science and visualization&nbsp;have bloomed in recent years, see below a list of my recent favorites<br /><h1>Mathematics history:</h1><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10672848-the-theory-that-would-not-die" target="_blank">The Theory That Would Not Die: How Bayes' Rule Cracked the Enigma Code, Hunted Down Russian Submarines, and Emerged Triumphant from Two Centuries of Controversy</a></strong>&nbsp;<span class="by smallText">by</span>&nbsp;Sharon Bertsch McGrayne<br /><em>Fascinating stories about the often forgotten and yet always&nbsp;resuscitated Bayes theorem, and quite insightful in how mathematics and science can also be a fierce battle between people holding different views.</em></li><li><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15865525-th-or-me-vivant" target="_blank">Théorème vivant</a><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><span class="by smallText">by</span>&nbsp;Cédric Villani.<br />This book confirmed to me, I would never have the knack to become an academic.</li></ul><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17986418-naked-statistics" target="_blank">Naked Statistics: Stripping the Dread from the Data</a></strong>&nbsp;<span class="by smallText">by</span>&nbsp;Charles Wheelan.<br />Simple and entertaining introduction to statistical concept, I should have read that long ago, before going back to university.</li></ul><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44882.Code" target="_blank">Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software</a></strong>&nbsp;<span class="by smallText">by</span>&nbsp;Charles Petzold<br />I found this book very accessible, and I like the way it started from the very basic without using electronic to go on to explain how our computer ( dominating our world ) works. The last chapters were a bit disappointing I have to say, probably a bit outdated, but I would recommend it to anybody who actually want to understand electronic hardware.</li></ul><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7249817-information-is-beautiful" target="_blank">Information is Beautiful</a>&nbsp;</strong><span class="by smallText">by</span>&nbsp;David McCandless.<br /></li></ul><h1>Economics:</h1><ul><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1202.Freakonomics" target="_blank"><strong>Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything&nbsp;(Freakonomics #1</strong>)</a>&nbsp;<span class="by smallText">by</span>&nbsp;Steven D.
