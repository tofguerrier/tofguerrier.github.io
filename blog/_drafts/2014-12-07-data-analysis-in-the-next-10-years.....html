After reading this interesting list "<a title="17 areas to benefit from data analytics" href="http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/17-areas-to-benefit-from-big-data-analytics-in-next-10-years">17 areas to benefit from big data analytics in the next 10 years</a>" by V.Granville, I thought I put on my own list of areas where I think Data Analytics could growth and generate improvements.<br/><ol><br/>	<li>Education: So far the initiatives I have seen have focused on the student and how to improve their success. But we could also look at the performance of teachers and professor, with the rise of online material (video lectures, notes ... ), we can potentially measure how engaging and how impactful the teachers are.<br/>May be we also need to look at more studies like <a title="Preschool influence study" href="http://www.highscope.org/content.asp?contentid=219">The HighScope Perry Preschool Study</a>, which showed the benefits of pre schooling, to create better policies.</li><br/>	<li>Historical records: Right now, and for the foreseeable future, we are being able to get more and more data at a cheaper cost, greater speed, precision and variety. All this data was not available in the past, but long term historical records</li><br/>	<li>Economics: macroeconomics and microenomics, long term data analysis issue ( we ahev more data than in the past, how do we combine our past knowledge and theory and reconcile with our current data and evolution ) ...</li><br/>	<li>Urban planning, housing,</li><br/>	<li>Social housing and social policy</li><br/>	<li>Nudging and politics efficiency</li><br/>	<li>Corruption reduction ( again politcs )</li><br/>	<li>History : analysis of text and history / anthroplogy</li><br/>	<li>Search and Rescue/Recovery operations</li><br/>	<li>Recycling and waste reduction / Water wastage recycling</li><br/>	<li>Epidemic and pandemic : prevision and containment<br/>At the moment data analytics are helping drawing maps of the contagion for Ebola, helping the medical aid/treatment. Helpingto find the root cause ( for example where does the virus sleep when it becomes dormant ).</li><br/>	<li>Internet of things: actually si much data is going to become available that it is hard to see what we will be able to do with it. And one of the first task is going to try to make sense of it all. For example baby monitors can be covered with sensors ( monitoring from breathing rate, to sleeping position, heart rate ) , but all that information will makes no sense to the parents, unless the information is treated, summarize, displayed in a simple and intuitive manner,</li><br/></ol><br/>Reading: with more and more people reading on tablet/phones, we are going to be able to get more information on how people read. When do they, what passage do they read slowly, faster, reread... etc<br/><br/>&nbsp;<br/><br/>On the things which seems deemed to happened:<br/><br/>- more tailored discount, ie discount will be integrated into your bills. fidelity programs.<br/><br/>- recruiting / HR<br/><br/>- sensor that can read stress level: http://www.wired.com/2014/12/sensors-test-stress-revolutionize-product-design/<br/><br/>&nbsp;<br/><br/>- construction http://newsroom.intel.com/community/en_ie/blog/2014/12/04/intel-ireland-collaborate-with-construction-partners-to-host-lean-construction-expo<br/><br/>&nbsp;<br/><br/>&nbsp;<br/><br/>use: Ted talk : <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/clay_shirky_how_cognitive_surplus_will_change_the_world?language=en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.ted.com/talks/clay_shirky_how_cognitive_surplus_will_change_the_world?language=en</a><br/>use SAP marketing prediction:<br/><a href="http://www.news-sap.com/consumer-goods-companies-can-capitalize-retailer-data/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.news-sap.com/consumer-goods-companies-can-capitalize-retailer-data/</a><br/><br/>Area where data analytics can help:<br/>geriatrics<br/>voice for the third world<br/>change societey / civic values / mood modifier / politics
