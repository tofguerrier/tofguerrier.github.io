UNDER MASSIVE REVIEW - AUGUST 2018


This page was inspired by Thomas Frank `Impossible List <https://collegeinfogeek.com/about/meet-the-author/my-impossible-list/>`.
Over the years I have been writing multiple, duplicate, ever-evolving lists of things I wanted to do or visit.

So this page has several goals:
- simplify my now page, which was growing out of control with the listing of various aspirations.
- enable better tracking and force myself to take action on my list of goals.
- compile old multiple lists on one page.

This impossible list, is not a bucket list, even if at times it can feels like it, it is a way to challenge myself, to push me outside my comfort-zone.

This list is and will be under constant construction and revision (thanks git), last updated on **Saturday 21st April 2018**
