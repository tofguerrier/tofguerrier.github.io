# Comment Policy

- Comments are welcomed and encouraged.
- I want to keep this website as a place for open and respectful discussion, so there are a few things that I will not allow. All comments are subject to these terms of use and any commenter in violation of this policy may be banned at my sole discretion.
- In one word:
[RESPECT](https://youtu.be/_zv_Zoa-j2Q)
Basically open discussion and disagreement are welcome in comments, but rudeness or personal attacks will be suppressed.
- Be chilled, be kind and don't be a dick.
- All Rights Reserved: I reserve the right to edit, delete, move, or mark as spam any and all comments. I also reserve the right to block access via IP address to anyone or group from commenting, for violation of this comment policy.

I look forward to read and engage with your comments.
