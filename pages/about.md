## Me in 30 seconds
I am French from the gorgeous [Auvergne]("http://www.auvergne-tourism.com") region, living in Ireland since 2005.
I have a strong background in microelectronic engineering, with an extended experience in physical design.

For the personal part in no particular order:
 snorkeler and scuba enthusiast, geek, python coding addict, proud father, amateur photographer, music lover, rusty cyclist and clumsy surfer - meaning I wipe out a lot.

I now live in Dublin after spending a couple of years in the French Alps, and about 8 years on the west coast of Ireland.

I am curious about science and technology in general.

I enjoy listening to different points of views, I am a big fan of radio drama and documentaries which luckily now can be easily found in podcasts format.

Personality type: [INTJ](https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personalityJ), which probably qualify me as an introvert but I am more of a Social type introvert based on this Scientific American article: [What Kind of Introvert Are You?](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/beautiful-minds/what-kind-of-introvert-are-you/)
My Personality results using the [Big Five](https://bigfive-test.com/result/5b7151e5be6411005a5e01bd) are  5b7151e5be6411005a5e01bd

I enjoy time spend alone, getting fully immerse in my project or craft, lost within my own thoughts, in other word the flow. I enjoy outdoors activities by the sea, I used to scuba-dive on the Clare coast.

Minimalist, tidy, organized, longtime bookworm addict, kind some say, I usually appear grumpy.
Generally happy and drama avoider, quite moody at time, and sometime [antisocial](https://youtu.be/NOVhneQqdvo) but improving with age.

## My ideal day:
  - Wake up early, with the rising sun, if possible with a view of the sea.
  - Go spend the day at sea (West coast of Ireland if possible ), either snorkeling, diving, surfing, sailing or boating.
  - Eat outdoor on the pier, coffee and cake.
  - Come back home, read stories to my daughter until she fell asleep, finish the day with a good book.

## Education
  - Blaise Pascal University (Auvergne, France): PostGrad Microelectronics, Msc/Bsc Physics (Licence/Maitrise Physique)
  - UCD (Dublin, Ireland): Higher Diploma in Statistics

## Books and music
  - My favourite book is: Perdido Street Station by China Mieville (at the moment ).
  - My favourite bands are: Jethro Tull and Radiohead.
