      <p>This page was inspired by <a href="https://collegeinfogeek.com/about/meet-the-author/my-impossible-list/">Thomas Frank Impossible List</a>.</p>
<p>Over the years I have been writing multiple, duplicate, ever-evolving lists of things I wanted to do or visit.</p>
<p>So with this page, I have several goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>simplify other pages which was growing out of control with the listing of various aspirations.</li>
<li>enable better tracking and force myself to take action on my list of goals.</li>
<li>compile old multiple lists on one page.</li>
</ul>
<p>This impossible list, is not a bucket list, even if at times it can feels like it, it is a way to challenge myself, to push me outside my comfort-zone.</p>
<p>This list is and will be under constant construction and revision (thanks git).</p>
