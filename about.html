<h1>Me in 10 seconds</h1>
<p>I'm an engineer, a father, an ex-scubadiver.</p>
<p>I'm curious about science in general, 
I enjoy listening to different points of view, radio drama and radio documentaries.
</p>
<p>
Introvert (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INTJ">INTJ</a>). I love solitude, doing my own thing, getting lost in my own thoughts.
</p>
<p>
Minimalist, organized, longtime bookworm addict, kind.
</p>
<p>
French born. Auvergnat at heart. I now live in Dublin after spending few years in the French Alps, and the west coast of Ireland.
</p>

<p>My ideal day:
<ul>
<li>wake up early, with the rising sun.</li>
<li>go spend the day by the sea (if possible on the west coast of Ireland), doing a bit of snorkeliing/diving/surfing/sailing/boating</li>
<li>have piquenique on a pier, or a coffee there</li>
<li>arrive late at home, and fall into bed.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>
Genrally happy and anti-drama,  moody at time, and sometime antisocial. 
</p>

<p><ul>
<li>My favorite book is: Perdido Street Station by China Mieville (at the moment )</li>
<li>My favorite bands are: Jethro Tull and Radiohead.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>
CURRENT UPDATE: Here's what I'm doing <a href="tofguerrier.github.io/now">now</a>.
