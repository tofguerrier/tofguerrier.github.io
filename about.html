<h1>Me in 10 seconds</h1>
I'm an engineer, a father, an ex-scubadiver, expert surf-wiper.

I'm curious about science in general, 
I enjoy listening to different points of view, radio drama and radio documentaries.

Total introvert (INTJ). I thrive in solitude.

Minimalist. ??

French born. Auvergnat at heart. I now live in Dublin after spending few years in the French Alps, and the west coast of Ireland.

My ideal day:

Deeply happy and anti-drama, 

my favorite book is: 
my favorite bands are:
