</footer><!-- /.post-info -->        <p><em>Location:</em> Dublin, Ireland</p>
<p><em>Current Gig:</em> ‎Lead Physical Digital Implementation Engineer at Adesto/S3 semiconductors</p>
<p><em>One word that best describes how you work:</em> juggling</p>
<p><em>Current mobile device:</em> Sony Experia (Android 8.0)</p>
<p><em>Current personal computer:</em> MacBook Pro (old 2012)</p>
<p><em>Work Computer:</em> Windows 10 laptop, No machine to unix workstation (vpn) and Grid engine to submit various tools jobs.</p>
<p>A little about my background and how I got to where I am today.
Studied Physics in Clermont-Ferrand, France, followed on by a master in Microelectronics which I finished with a work placement in small company in Grenoble (Dolphin Integration). After that I decided to go abroad, and landed in Ireland on the west coast, there I transferred from Analog Layout to digital Physical Implementation. I work in Integrated Circuit design for a couple of companies, alternating between my two areas of expertise: analog and digital physical implementation, until I join my current employer.</p>
<h2>On a Typical Work Day</h2>
<ul>
<li>Wake up at 7:00AM:</li>
<li>get myself dressed.</li>
<li>wake up kid, get them dressed and let have them breakfast.</li>
<li>prepare lunch box for the kid.</li>
<li>Bring kid to school by car, walk in the park (unless my wife does it).</li>
<li>Due to covid lockdown, working from home, so setup and start logging in from my kitchen.</li>
<li>Once at my desk:<ul>
<li>List/review tasks and priorities for the day on my work notebook.</li>
<li>Check email/Jira tickets and email replies</li>
<li>Start on first task of the day and move on. Usually start with analysing results from overnight runs / review logs and reports</li>
<li>Loop over</li>
<li>Multiple breaks (lunch/coffee) so i don't spend all day sit at my desk, I actually need to stand up and move every so often.</li>
<li>10 minutes before end of the day:</li>
<li>Review tasks status, write next day task in notebook.</li>
<li>Email progress and issues found.</li>
<li>List additional tasks for following day.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>My wife usually does the after-school pickup, but I might do it.</li>
<li>Coloring with the kid</li>
<li>Prepare dinner, family time, dinner all together.</li>
<li>19:00 to 20:00 kid bedtime routine (brushing teeth, wash face, story time, quiet time).</li>
<li>Reading after that for me.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Appps, software, or tools I use</h2>
<ul>
<li>Notebook - draft paper.</li>
<li>Apps/Software: <ul>
<li>Google Keep for quick capture on my phone. </li>
<li>vi/gvim still for me the best editor. NotePad++ on Windows, and been slowly converted to MS Visual Code on Mac.</li>
<li>Python whenever I can.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>My workspace setup</h2>
<p>In the office i have dual screen, with one always on the linux workstation connection, and the other alternating between Chrome(online documentation),outlook(email) and Onenote. Beside this I have my earphone, and a notebook open.
Reduced to single external screen at home ( dual with the laptop one )</p>
<h2>My best time-saving shortcut</h2>
<p>Reduce and Prioritize and focus on only one single task at a time for 10 minutes. Basically blocked focused session.
Be intentional with my time and the time of others.
Took me a long time to get it, and I still fall behind sometimes.
Besides my phone and computer, I could not live without a notebook and pen.</p>
<h2>On good meetings</h2>
<p>Good meetings are rare those days, I am missing a clear outcome announced ahead of the meeting, however meetings do not tend to last too long.</p>
<h2>Listening habits while at work</h2>
<p>Depending on the tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>mostly podcasts (Freakonomics, Planet Money, Rationally Speaking, ....) </li>
<li>if needing more concentration:<ul>
<li>Online Radio: BBC 6 recommends  especially Mary Ann Hobbes.</li>
<li>Jazz Playlist.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>My Key Strength</h2>
<p>Most other engineer are (much) better than me on very specific tasks/areas, but I have a broad array of knowledge in IC design, more fox than hedgehog.</p>
<h2>Relaxing and recharging</h2>
<p>Getting better at this through the years, I only need a simple walk in nature.
What’s your sleep routine like? Are you a night owl or early-riser?
Go to bed around 9PM-10PM and read a book. I am more of an early-riser, I feel much better when I can wake up and start the day early. I usually slump in the afternoon.</p>
<h2>Best advice I have ever received</h2>
<p>One received recently: 
Do not hesiate to voice your unhappiness about stuff at work, don't wait until you reach meltdown to ask for help or voice your concern and issues.</p>
