What I’m doing now

(This is a now page, and if you have your own site, taking derek sivers example you should make one, too. http://nownownow.com/about)

I’m in Ireland, staying quite focused, avoiding distractions. I spend all my time on these things: (in order of time spent)

spending about 30 hours a week of one-on-one full-attention time with my kid
programming these projects (see my progress)
writing new articles, mostly around this theme
answering emails that ask my advice
reading books to better think, work, or live
weightlifting 3× a week (as described here and here)
listening to “The 23 Greatest Solo Piano Works” course. (I’ve gone through three of his courses, and they’re all amazing.)
Those are my priorities. I don’t want to do anything else right now. (No more interviews or speaking at conferences until further notice.) No hanging out or meeting up, either.

People often ask me to do other things. I sincerely wish them the best, and often wish I could help more, but I say no to all requests, because I just need to focus on my work. For years, I spent most of my time saying yes to people’s requests, but got nothing done myself.

I only do things for intrinsic reasons — not money.
