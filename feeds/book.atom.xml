&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summary:
It is about miscommunication and the "wrong" assumptions one makes when talking to strangers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My opinion:
First I have been a long time big fan of Malcolm Gladwell, and I enjoy the way he can summarize deep and complicated social and scientific insight into the format of a compelling story. Sometimes it can backfire and become over-simplistic, but the story is there, and we are stories people and Mr Gladwell is a great story teller.
Now, I was a bit confused by this book, and in the end it is probably the work of his at least enjoyed, the issue he is exploring is very complex and he is not quite able to condense it into a simple storyline, because it cannot.
It is pardoxical, that I was annoyed by the absence of a single punchline and simple explanation, when at the same time, I have been well aware that it is the exact default of Malcolm Gladwell writtings.
May be this book is more suited to the podcast format&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to challenge your preconceptions, your existing notions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When confronted with somebody out of the "norm", &lt;/p&gt;
