  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <div style="text-align: justify;">So I have this silly idea, to change career and move into Data Science, yes that very hyped field at this moment, hyped by the success of Amazon, Google, the writings of Nate Silver, books like "Moneyball", the falling costs of data accumulation.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">In my defense I had that idea for good few years. When I was a kid, I tinkered with the data of games I played on my computer; like plotting dreadful pie chart representing my type of plane usage in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Their_Finest_Hour_(video_game)" target="_blank" title="game">WWII combat flight simulator video game</a>. Later I have also tried to put more data driven decision in my own engineering career. You would imagine that being an engineer, that most of my work would be data driven, but actually half of my career was more driven by aesthetics and some weird perception of artistry (you can read about the art of layout and my job <a href="http://kindredspiritus.blogspot.ie/2012/08/work-what-feck-do-i-do.html" target="_blank" title="wtf my job is">there</a>&nbsp;).</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">Data Science - I am not a big fan of that name, but until I find a better one, I'll stick to that - &nbsp;has gained loads of attraction, so much hyped that recently some have announced that the bubble was bursting: "<a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/datawarehousing/entry/why_the_data_scientist_bubble" target="_blank" title="Oracle Data Scientist Bubble Burst">The bubble is bursting because what I am seeing is more and more tools coming to market (soon) that will drive data science into the day-to-day job of all business people.</a>"</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">As a consequence&nbsp;more and more people are trying to get into this field (not necessarily a good thing for me, since that mean more competition), &nbsp;but also more demands as more and more companies realize that they'd like to use the potential of data analytics, data driven decision making and predictive analytics.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">I am quite fond of the following definition for data scientist: "A data scientist is someone who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician." And fancy myself fitting into that venn diagram.</div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zHe469jTdIg/VWAv8yCij5I/AAAAAAAAEBo/_Tz3CUzASxk/s1600/vdds.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img alt="" border="0" height="480" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zHe469jTdIg/VWAv8yCij5I/AAAAAAAAEBo/_Tz3CUzASxk/s640/vdds.png" title="data scientist skill" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Finding a place to fit in ?</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">Somehow I can visualize myself right at the center of this diagram.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">So how do you get into the field when you have no credentials, no experience ....</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">My initial plan was:</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;"><em>1. Get some credentials, by going back to college (Msc). In particular reinforce my statistical knowledge.</em><br /><em> 2. Find a basic entry position, to gain experience and work from there.</em></div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">The plan was quite simplistic and overly optimistic.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">I don't think I got it too much wrong, but I underestimated the amount of learning, training and more especially practice I would have to go through.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">I have know recognize this error and I am working towards fixing this. I also been comforted in my views, by a lightning talk by @saoili in Pycon Dublin on how to bootstrap a programming career.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">So few lessons:</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">Number 1:<br /><strong>Practice</strong> is key ! Whatever you learn, practice it, over and over.<br />Somehow I knew that, because when I started my engineering career, that is exactly what I have done, but it seems I forgot that over the years.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">Number 2:<br />Put all you learn into <strong>practice</strong>, ask questions to yourself, to others, fail, and learn from your mistakes and failures, then practice again. Try new things, experiment. Accept that failure is part of the process. I am&nbsp;more and more convinced that if I&nbsp;do not fail at one stage ( or multiple ), I&nbsp;have learned nothing new, or&nbsp;I haven't tried hard enough. <strong>Ask</strong> for help, if you are stuck.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">Number 3:<br /><strong>Share</strong> your knowledge. Whatever the small amount you managed to master or understand, go and try to explain it to someone else, teach others, help them to discover how to do this.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">I did go back to college, to pursue a Msc in Statistics in UCD. The program and experience were great, but I struggle. Weirdly I struggled on the most basic concept of statistics, which I had forgotten since I was last in college or never assimilated. In the end, I used online resources to help my comprehension, I probably could have done this before starting college, which would have got me better results.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">Online learning resources ( starting from all levels) for statistics:</div><ul style="text-align: justify;"><br /><li><strong>Khan Academy</strong>&nbsp;Probability and statistics track:<br /><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability%C2%A0" target="_blank" title="Khan Academy">https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability&nbsp;</a></li><br /><li>Harvard Stat 110: <a href="http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/home" target="_blank">Probability (available freely on Itunes)</a></li><br /><li>Coursera in particular&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience" target="_blank" title="Coursera TRack">Johns Hopkins University&nbsp;Data Science</a>.</li></ul><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">I also realized that my programming skills were stucked into scripting mode (perl, tcl, any unix bash shell). So I went onto upgrading myself, initially using R, but more and more with Python.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">Online learning resources for programming - focusing on Python:</div><ul style="text-align: justify;"><br /><li>CodeAcademy (<a href="http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python" target="_blank">&nbsp;http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python</a> )</li><br /><li>Learn Python the hard way ( it will encourage you to practice over and over ).<br /><a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/" target="_blank">http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/</a></li><br /><li>MIT online free course see itunes check:&nbsp;<a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/">http://ocw.mit.edu</a><br />In particular the intro to <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00sc-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-spring-2011/" target="_blank">Computer Science</a>.</li></ul><div style="text-align: center;">-----</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Practice</strong></div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">Off course, as previously stated, practice is key, and there some handful website to practice your programming (python skills):</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">Practicing python programming:</div><ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Project Euler, mathematics problem to be solved with some programming.<br /><a href="https://projecteuler.net/" target="_blank">https://projecteuler.net/</a></li><br /><li>Checkio.org, a set of challenge in Python.<br /><a href="http://www.checkio.org/" target="_blank">http://www.checkio.org/</a></li></ul><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">To practice data analytics and statistics: coursera and KHANACADEMY includes exercises and homework, but after that, you can compete in real problems:</div><ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>Kaggle competition:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/" target="_blank">https://www.kaggle.com/</a><br />The site include tutorial on machine learning, decisions tree, I would recommend to go through (Titanic and Digits challenges)</li></ul><div style="text-align: justify;">How do you start practising ? find a problem to solve, an issue you are curious, and jump right in from there.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sharing.</strong><br />Also the following resources turned helpful to share your code, find solution when you are stuck, meet like minded people.</div><ul style="text-align: justify;"><li>github ( <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">https://github.com/ </a>) to show off your code, and browse the code of others.</li><br /><li>Stack overflow (&nbsp;<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">https://stackoverflow.com/</a> ): brilliant resource for anything you may get stuck in. Also once you've become proficient, share and help others.</li><br /><li>meetup (&nbsp;<a href="http://www.meetup.com/" target="_blank">http://www.meetup.com/ </a>) &nbsp;to find local people with similar interests.</li><br /><li><a href="http://python.ie/" target="_blank">python.ie</a>, if you are in Dublin, IE, very active community.</li></ul><div style="text-align: justify;">After a couple of months here is my updated plan ( and more detailed):<br /><em><br /></em><br /><ul><li><em>Become (reasonably) proficient in :</em></li><ul><li><em>Statistics, and statistical methods.</em></li><ul><li><em>Possibly pass a&nbsp;professional examinations in statistics from the <a href="http://www.rss.org.uk/" target="_blank" title="Royal Statistical Society">Royal Statistical Society</a></em></li></ul><li><em>programing / computer stuff.</em></li><ul><li><em>python and <a href="http://www.numpy.org/" target="_blank" title="Numpy">numpy</a>, scipy, <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/" target="_blank" title="SciKit Learn">scikit</a>.</em></li><li><em>R and package like ggplot2.</em></li><li><em>sql, hadoop, mapreduce database management.</em></li></ul></ul><li><em>Share knowledge, meet other data scientist, pythonista..</em></li><ul><li><em>Contribute to Stackoverflow.</em></li><li><em>Publish more of my projects on this blog.</em></li><li><em>Participate in data analytics, use Kaggle, DataKind....</em></li></ul><li><em>Apply for jobs in the desired area. (many many many times.... )</em></li></ul></div><ol style="text-align: justify;"></ol><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">I still like to get better&nbsp;credentials - I do have now a Higher Diploma in Statistics from UCD not the initial desired Msc &nbsp;- , to help build my resume, but that is no longer a priority. I know and realize that I have much more to learn.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">Will I succeed in hacking my way there ?<br /><br />I don't know, but I will try.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
