It all started with this internet meme:<br/><br/><i>This morning more than 30 trucks filled with 5-cent coins arrived at Apple’s headquarters in California. Initially, the security company that protects the facility said the trucks were in the wrong place, but minutes later, Tim Cook (Apple CEO) received a call from Samsung CEO explaining that they will pay $1 billion dollars for the fine recently ruled against the South Korean company in this way.</i><br/><br/>It turned out to be an hoax, but there is something interesting there.<br/><br/>My mind keep asking would 1 billion in 5 cent coins fit in 30 trucks ?<br/><br/>So let's do the maths... a nickel ( 5 cent coins ) has the following dimensions:<br/><ul><br/>	<li>Value  : 0.05 U.S. dollar</li><br/>	<li>Mass : 5.000 g</li><br/>	<li>Diameter : 21.21 mm</li><br/>	<li>Thickness : 1.95 mm</li><br/></ul><br/>So we can find the volume ( pardon me if I stick to metric ), as the coin is basically a cylinder.<br/><br/>Volume = Pi*Diameter*Diameter*Thickness<br/><br/>Volume = 2755.91501576388 mm2 = 0.00275591502 meters squared<br/><br/>To get 1 billion dollars in Nickels you need:<br/><br/>Number of coins = 10^9 / 0.05 = 20 000 000 000 ( 20 billions coins )<br/><br/>Total volume occupied by the coins:<br/><br/>TV = Total Volume = Number of coins * Volume  = 55118300.4 meters squared<br/><br/>Weight:<br/><br/>Number of coins * Weight = 100 000 000 kilograms<br/><br/>If i pick a standard intermodal container, the one you can find on ships, its external dimension are:<br/><ul><br/>	<li>Length (12,192 m)</li><br/>	<li>Width (2,438 m)</li><br/>	<li>Height (2,591 m)</li><br/></ul><br/>So a volume of: 77.<a href="tel:015132736" target="_blank">015132736</a> meters squared, when you divide the Total volume of coins by the volume of a container you get the number of containers needed.<br/><br/>So you would need 715 682.43 containers … and as many trucks…<br/><br/>The biggest container vessel (example MV edith ) can take 15000 TEU<br/><br/>so you would need 48 of those ( 47.71 ) to transport the coins from south korea to the USA.<br/><br/>The other question would be how many 5 cent coins can you fit in 30 trucks ?<br/><br/>And what are the results if you use 1 dollar bill or 100 dollars bill ?<br/><div></div><br/><div><br/><div dir="ltr"><a href="http://about.me/christophe_guerrier" target="_blank">guerrier</a></div><br/></div>
