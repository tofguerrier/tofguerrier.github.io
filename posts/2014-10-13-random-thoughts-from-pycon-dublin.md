Summary: Pycon 2014

Over the weekend I attended my first Pycon in Dublin, Ireland. 
It is organised by the wonderful crowd of [Python Ireland](http://python.ie/), I would actually recommend that you go to one of their monthly meetups if you have any interest in the Python language.

I was not sure what to expect, but the experience turned out to be truly enjoyable, and I finished up the weekend, my head full of ideas to investigate with python.

Here's my favourite highlights of the weekend, in no particular order.

- Ian Ozsvald [@ianozsvald](https://twitter.com/ianozsvald)
_The Real Unsolved Problems in Data Science_ You can read it there:[http://ianozsvald.com/2014/10/11/my-keynote-at-pyconireland-2014-the-real-unsolved-problems-in-data-science/](http://ianozsvald.com/2014/10/11/my-keynote-at-pyconireland-2014-the-real-unsolved-problems-in-data-science/)

- A lightning talk by [@saoili](https://twitter.com/saoili") about getting into python jobs, which comfort me in my current chosen path.

See her lightning talk [slides](http://t.co/xTvf1Y2k4e).
- On the same lightning talk show, a very entertaining demonstration of failing at data science (Homeless cloud by an engineer from rehabstudios, I forgot the name), but also a silent presentation by [@dontusethiscode](href="https://twitter.com/dontusethiscode")

- Rachel Willmer [@rwillmer](https://twitter.com/rwillmer) in her keynote: _A Tech Person's Adventures in Startup_, gave me some inspiration and food for thoughts on creating your own company.

- I realize that Python was widely used in the financial industry (something I did not know before ) thanks to Dr. Yves J. Hilpisch [@dyjh](https://twitter.com/dyjh) keynote : _Python and the Financial Industry_.

- Finally a very cool demonstration, inside iPython notebook on how to build an earth centered universe by Brandon Rhodes [@brandon_rhodes](https://twitter.com/brandon_rhodes).


Overall fun, exciting and energizing conference, I will probably be back next year, more engaged.
