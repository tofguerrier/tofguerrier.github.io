## First of all, tell me a little about your background and how you got to where you are today.
Studied Physics in Clermont-Ferrand, France, followed on by a master in Microelectronics which I finished with a work placement in small company in Grenoble (Dolphin Integration). After that I decided to go abroad, and landed in Ireland on the west coast, there I transferred from Analog Layout to digital Physical Implementation. I work in Integrated Circuit design for a couple of companies, alternating between my two areas of expertise: analog and digital physical implementation, until I join my current employer.

## How do you organise your day:
- walk to work:
  - chat about goat/moon with my kid on the way.
  - drop my kid to childminder
  - listen to some podcast on the way.
- Once at my desk:
  - list/review tasks for the day. Using daily planner notebook.
  - check email
  - list priorities / sort and review tasks.
- email replies
- start on first tasks and move on.
  - usually start with analysing results from overnight runs / review logs and reports
  - if possible parallelise tasks (for example kicking off a run/ so in the meantime i can do another review/scripting/manual edit/read documentations)
  - loop over
- multiple breaks (lunch/coffee) so i don't spend all day sit at my desk, I actually need to stand up and move every so often.
- 10 minutes before end of the day:
  - review tasks status.
  - email progress and issues found.
  - list additional tasks for following day using my notebook.
- walk home:
  - listening to some more podcast.
  - pickup my kid from childminder on the way back.
  - enquire about the kid activities.

## What apps, software, or tools can’t you live without? Why?
- Simple Notebook for simple drafting/note taking, jog down ideas, simple calculation.
- Daily dated planner, to list taks/meeting and track progress.

Apps/Software:
- Google Keep for quick capture on my phone.
- gvim/vi (Atom in vi mode at home) for script editing and coding.
- OneNote for note sharing.

## What’s your workspace setup like ?
- In the office i have dual screen, with one always on the linux workstation connection, and the other alternating between Chrome(online documentation),outlook(email) and Onenote.
Beside this I have my earphone, and a notebook open.

## What’s your best time-saving shortcut or life hack?
- Reduce and Prioritize and focus on only one single task at a time for 10 minutes. Basically blocked focused session. Took me a long time to get it, and I still fall behind sometimes.

## Besides your phone and computer, what gadget or tool can’t you live without and why?
A notebook and pen.

## What do you listen to while you work?
Depending on the tasks:
- mostly podcasts (Freakonomics, Planet Money, Rationally Speaking, ....)
- if needing more concentration online radio:
  - BBC 6 recommends
  - FIP
  - France Inter Transmission

## What are you currently reading ?
- The Glass Book of Dream Eaters
- Le Rivage des Syrtes by Julien Gracq

## What everyday thing are you better at than everyone else? What’s your secret?
- Most other engineer are (much) better than me on very specific tasks/areas, but I have a broad array of knowledge in IC design, more fox than hedgehog.

## How do you recharge? What do you do to forget about work?
- Getting better at this through the years, I only need a simple walk in nature.

## What’s your sleep routine like? Are you a night owl or early-riser?
- Go to bed around 9PM-10PM and read a book. I am more of an early-riser, I feel much better when I can wake up and start the day early. I usually slump in the afternoon.

## What’s the best advice you’ve ever received ?
- One received recently: voice your unhappiness about stuff at work.
