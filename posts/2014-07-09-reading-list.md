The number of Books on data science and visualisation have bloomed in recent years, see below a list of my recent favourites

## Mathematics history:
+ [Theory That Would Not Die: How Bayes' Rule Cracked the Enigma Code, Hunted Down Russian Submarines, and Emerged Triumphant from Two Centuries of Controversy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10672848-the-theory-that-would-not-die) by Sharon Bertsch McGrayne
Fascinating stories about the often forgotten and yet always resuscitated Bayes theorem, and quite insightful in how mathematics and science can also be a fierce battle between people holding different views.
+ [Théorème vivant](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15865525-th-or-me-vivant) by Cédric Villani
 This book confirmed to me, I would never have the knack to become an academic.
 + [Naked Statistics: Stripping the Dread from the Data](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17986418-naked-statistics) by Charles Wheelan.
 Simple and entertaining introduction to statistical concept, I should have read that long ago, before going back to university.
 + [Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44882.Code) by Charles Petzold
 I found this book very accessible, and I like the way it started from the very basic without using electronic to go on to explain how our computer ( dominating our world ) works. The last chapters were a bit disappointing I have to say, probably a bit outdated, but I would recommend it to anybody who actually want to understand electronic hardware.
 + [Information is Beautiful](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7249817-information-is-beautiful) by David McCandless

## Economics:
+ [Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1202.Freakonomics) by Steven D. Levitt, Stephen J. Dubner.
+ [SuperFreakonomics: Global Cooling, Patriotic Prostitutes And Why Suicide Bombers Should Buy Life Insurance](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6402364-superfreakonomics)  by Steven D. Levitt, Stephen J. Dubner.
I simply love anything those guys do, ,either in podcast format or in book.
+ [The Undercover Economist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/70420.The_Undercover_Economist)  by Tim Harford.
In the same vain, quite good at explaining basic economics concept and how they can apply to everybody daily life.

## Data Science:
+ [The Signal and the Noise: The Art and Science of Prediction](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13588394-the-signal-and-the-noise)  by Nate Silver.
Another bayesian book, you probably heard of Nate Silver, the book is not without default, but yet still a must read.
+ [Untangling the Web: What the internet is doing to you](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17847037-untangling-the-web) by Aleks Krotoski.
To understand how the web is changing our life, magnifying our humans traits.

## Reference books:
I probably use those two books every other day to get examples of graphs, or ideas of coding.

+ [Visualize This](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11054622-visualize-this) by Nathan Yau.

+ [The Art of R Programming: A Tour of Statistical Software](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11746626-the-art-of-r-programming) by Norman Matloff.
